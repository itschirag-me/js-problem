# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Study Plan

Welcome to my DSA study repository! This repository serves as my personal guide to mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), which is crucial for improving problem-solving skills and performing well in coding interviews. The plan is structured into daily and weekly goals, with various resources, topics, and problems to practice.

## Why DSA?

- **Improve Problem-Solving Skills:** DSA forms the core of problem-solving in computer science.
- **Interview Preparation:** Most tech companies focus on DSA during technical interviews.
- **Optimize Code:** Helps in writing efficient and scalable code.
